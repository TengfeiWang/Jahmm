CHANGES
=======

0.6.0
-----
- Major modifications in the way genericity is used.
- ViterbiCalculator is not generic anymore.
- Handles unreachable states (thanks M. Krueger).
- HMMReader.read and HMMWriter.write are static.
- Genericity of HMM changed.
- Packages apps.cli (command line interface) added.
- Number of iterations of Baum-Welch learner can be changed.
- BW Learners are not generics anymore.


0.5.0
-----
- Porting to Java 1.5: end.  Now uses generics extensively.
- Bugfix (Gaussian Mixture - random generator, thanks A. Momeni).
- KMeansCompatible renamed CentroidFactory.
- OpdfFactory now only has a "factor" method.
- ObservationDiscrete and related opdf.
- Only one class convert HMM to dot files (GenericHmmDrawerDot).
- MarkovGenerator now generates multiple sequences.
- Sources include regression (i.e. JUnit) tests.


0.4.1
-----
- Bugfix in OpdfMultiGaussian.java


0.4.0
-----
- Porting to Java 1.5: continued.
- Includes a few (JUnit) regression tests.
- Removed jahmm.apps package from javadoc.


0.3.4
-----
- ObservationIntegerReader constructor with no argument throws
  an exception.
- Implements monovariate Gaussian mixtures (thanks to Benjamin Chung).
- Implements 'probability' method of all distributions in 'distribution'
  package.
- Compilation requires Java 1.5 (Opdf* uses generics).


0.3.3
-----
- Includes JahmmViz 0.2.1 (small bugfixes/enhancements).


0.3.2
-----
- Includes JahmmViz 0.2.0 (several improvements).
- Added observation sequences writers.
- Added real observations.
- Changed KullbackLeiblerDistanceCalculator constructors.
- 'test' package is now be.ac.ulg.montefiore.jahmm.run.test.


0.3.1
-----
- 2 bugfixes.
- Observation.toString(NumberFormat) added.
- Arguments of Hmm(double[] pi, double[][] a, Opdf[] opdfs) constructor are
  copied.


0.3.0
-----
- Modified Hmm constructors.
- distributions are not mutable.
- distributions are serializable.
- accessors to the parameters of distributions.
- opdf.toString() and opdf.toString(NumberFormat) added.
- Opdfs are cloneable and serializable.
- new javadoc entries.
- 'io' package re-organized.
- added 'gui' package.
- added 'apps' package (currently holds a library GUI, JahmmViz).


0.2.6
-----
- GPL licenced. Added missing resources directory.


0.2.5

  observation sequences) and bugfix.


0.2.2
-----
- Multivariate observation data file reading and bugfix.


0.2.1
